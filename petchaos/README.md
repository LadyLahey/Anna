PetChaos (MVP)

Onboarding: Hatch -> Feed -> Reveal
Minimal pet engine: deterministic species/traits from text
Mock Chaos Tokens store: purchase + spend to mutate
Basic text filter

Run

npm install
npm run ios

Notes

Payments are mocked (no Apple/Google integration yet)
Persistence uses AsyncStorage
Content filtering is client-only and basic; add server-side filters later
